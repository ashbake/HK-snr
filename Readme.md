Anaconda environment: py3


Purpose: 
-------
Calculate the SNR of H&K and KPF spectrometers give exposure time, stellar V magnitude, and stellar temperature

Usage:
----------
edit [var] parameters (T_eff (K), exp_time (s), vmag (generic Bessell V)) in calc_snr_max.cfg then run calc_snr_max.py to plot SNR of H&K and KPF spectrometers. Currently only certain T_eff values are allowed because this relies on which stellar Phoenix models are downloaded and placed in ./data/phoenix/

This code also has a function to generate  snr_master_hk.fits which is interpolated to match the KPF-ETC grids

To Do:
---------
Clean up plotting sequences, put into functions
Incorporate this into the KPF-ETC interpolator
Calculate errors on S_HK index and add saturation flag


Notes:
---------
This is a work in progress, dumping code here for future edits

Can check number of pixels KPF res element spans in following fits file:
